**Please please please do not push to master directly!**

Git 101:
- Create your own feature branch locally: `git branch <branch-name>`.
- Switch to your feature branch: `git checkout <branch-name>`.
- Do some magical work :D
- Add all changes to the staging area: `git add .`
  - If you want to add only one file, do `git add <filename>`.
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m <message>`. Leave a short message here.
- Push to github: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`.
  - If you have already set up your upstream branch (i.e., not the first time pushing to this branch), you can simply do `git push`.
- Go to Github, on `Code` tab, click the branch dropdown menu (which should say `master` by default), switch to your branch, and click the `Compare & pull request` green button.
- Describe your changes (as detailed as possible please) and click "Reviewers", add the rest of us.
- Once two other people have reviewed your code, the reviewers (at least David will keep monitoring the pull request tab) will message in discord server, notifying the author to merge the request.

Please message in discord server if there's any more questions.
Good luck and have fun!
